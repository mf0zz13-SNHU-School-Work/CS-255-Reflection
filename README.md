# CS-255-Reflection
### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project involved designing a system for a fictional client, DriverPass—a small business that offers online resources and in-person driving instruction to help new drivers pass their driving tests. They needed a system that could manage user accounts, schedule lessons, and track student progress for various types of users, including students, instructors, administrators, and secretaries.

### What did you do particularly well?
I did well translating the client’s business needs into clear, understandable documentation for a technical audience. My business requirements document effectively outlined both functional and nonfunctional requirements, while my use case and activity diagrams successfully captured how different users would interact with the system.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I were to revise one part of my work, it would be the use case diagram. While it included many relevant use cases, I now realize I could have added more student-specific use cases, especially around their interaction with the LMS (learning management system) portion of the platform.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted user needs by analyzing the roles outlined in the scenario and mapping those roles to corresponding system functions. This approach helped shape my use cases and design decisions, ensuring that the system would meet users’ goals. Considering user needs is essential in system design, as it ensures the final product is usable, functional, and aligned with real-world requirements.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
My approach includes clearly defining the problem, modeling user interactions with use case and activity diagrams, and iterating on designs based on feedback. In the future, I’ll continue to use UML tools, keep stakeholder needs central to design decisions, and leverage version control and documentation to support collaboration and maintain clarity throughout the development process.
